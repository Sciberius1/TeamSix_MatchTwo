# TeamSix_MatchTwo
User story: A school is having a contest for students to win tickets to the zoo. For this contest they decided on an Animal Memory Card Game. The student with the best time will win the tickets.

When the student opens the game, he enters his name.
When he enters his name, he can begin the game.
When he begins the game, he sees 16 cards face down.
As he clicks a card, it reveals a picture and stays up.
The can then pick another card and try to match the image.
If they do not reveal a match the cards return face down.
If they reveal a match the cards remain up.
The matching process continues untill all cards are matched.
This process is timed and the best time is recorded.
If the next student does not beat the time the current remains.
If the next student does beat the time their name and time become 'best'.
